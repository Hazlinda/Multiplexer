# Multiplexer
Multiplexer also known as Mux is a device that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards it to a single output line. A multiplexer of inputs has select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output.

The multiplexer is a combinational logic circuit designed to switch one of several input lines to a single common output line
